# AI Resources

## Learning

#### [Deep Learning Papers Reading Roadmap](https://github.com/floodsung/Deep-Learning-Papers-Reading-Roadmap)
If you are a beginner in the field of Deep Learning, you might wonder "Where do I get started?". Here is a reading roadmap of Deep Learning papers!

#### [Open AI Spinning up](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/index.html)
An educational resource produced by OpenAI that makes it easier to learn about deep reinforcement learning (deep RL).

#### [Arxiv Sanity](http://www.arxiv-sanity.com/)
Arxiv is great, but there are many papers and we don't have good interfaces for interacting with this large body of work. Arxiv Sanity is Andrej Karpathy's solution to this.

#### [AI Glossary](https://pathmind.com/wiki/glossary)
The intent of this glossary is to provide clear definitions of the technical terms specific to deep artificial neural networks. It is a work in progress.

## Tools

#### [Auptimizer](https://github.com/LGE-ARC-AdvancedAI/auptimizer)
An automatic ML model hyperparameter optimization tool. See related [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/duul7r/p_auptimizer_a_faster_easier_way_to_do_hpo/).

#### [OpenAI Gym](http://gym.openai.com/)
Gym is a toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms. It makes no assumptions about the structure of your agent, and is compatible with any numerical computation library, such as TensorFlow or Theano. The gym library is a collection of test problems — environments — that you can use to work out your reinforcement learning algorithms. These environments have a shared interface, allowing you to write general algorithms.

#### [PyBullet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10sXEhzFRSnvFcl3XxNGhnD4N2SedqwdAvK3dsihxVUA/edit#)
PyBullet is an easy to use Python module for physics simulation for robotics, games, visual effects and machine learning, with a focus on sim-to-real transfer.

#### [Unity ML-Agents Toolkit](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents)
The Unity Machine Learning Agents Toolkit (ML-Agents) is an open-source Unity plugin that enables games and simulations to serve as environments for training intelligent agents.

#### [OpenAI Gym Retro](https://github.com/openai/retro)
Gym Retro lets you turn classic video games into Gym environments for reinforcement learning and comes with integrations for ~1000 games.

## Tutorials

#### [The Building Blocks of Interpretability](https://distill.pub/2018/building-blocks/)
Making sense of the hidden layers.

#### [Mixed Precision Training Using NVIDIA Apex in Pytorch](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DMOxwMaY6_ztXcQDUyl6F0gD9imkLuHx/view?usp=sharing)
NVIDIA’s Turing and Volta architecture’s support half-precision
(16-bit) floating point operations. Due to the decreased size of
representing values in this form, throughput of arithmetic operations
and memory transfer can be increased whilst simultaneously reducing
the overall memory required to store values.

#### [Deploy ML models with Django](https://www.deploymachinelearning.com/)
Read related [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/dsvk20/p_deploy_machine_learning_models_with_django/).
